# Arrhythmia-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-

•Developed a robust heart disease classification model using Deep Learning techniques, achieving an
accuracyof 95.7% in training and 93.8% in testing with VGG19 model.
•Applied a comprehensive ECG image dataset and segmented into 15,341 training samples and 6,825 testing
samples, ensuring accurate model training and evaluation.
•Classified the ECG images into 6 different categories, which are related to heart disorders such as LBB, PAC,
PVC, RBB, VF, and Normal category for comprehensive arrhythmia diagnosis.
•Demonstrated proficiency in implementing 3 Deep Learning models(Custom CNN, VGG 19, and Inception
V3), significantly enhancing arrhythmia detection and diagnosis to contribute to the field of cardiac health
